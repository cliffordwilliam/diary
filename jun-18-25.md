# summary of what i did today

- learn bash
- make bash to check dev setup in a node backend setup

## learn bash

```bash
command_exists() {
  command -v "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1
}
```

this is a func def, you wanna use it like this `command_exists git`

`git` is the arg u pass into it, for that func def, the parameter is not explicitly named but we use the order `$1`

then the `command` is a built in bash that gets called on the arg using the `-v` flag

`command -v` returns path to command if it exists, this return is either stdout 1 or stderr 2 (the numbers are called `file descriptor`)

`>` means we redirect whatever the left returns, here we redirect to blackhole, as in dumped or trashed `/dev/null`

then we also explicitly say `2>&1` which means

redirects stderr to wherever stdout is going (which in this case is /dev/null). The > operator is just for redirecting output, and the & is used to indicate that 2 (stderr) is being redirected to 1 (stdout).

```bash
  if [ -n "$CONCURRENTLY_PID" ]; then
    kill -TERM $CONCURRENTLY_PID 2>/dev/null || true
  fi
```

this is the if block syntax, you write the condition in the []

if []; then
fi

-n "$ASD", is a conditional statement checking if the var $ASD has something or not assigned to it

if it has then it runs the if block logic

kill -TERM command sends a termination signal (SIGTERM) to the process with the ID
asks the process to stop gracefully (it allows the process to clean up resources, close files, etc.).

2 refers to stderr, means if there are any err we wanna redirect it to blackhole /dev/null

we do or operator to true so that it always returns true
this is because maybe kill may return something that stops the whole script

```bash
  if docker ps | grep -q "postgres"; then
    if [ -d "./asd/asd/asd/asd" ]; then
      cd ./asd/asd/asd/asd || exit
    fi
    if command_exists docker-compose; then
      docker-compose down
    else
      docker compose down
    fi
    cd ../../../..
  fi
```

`docker ps` is a docker command, the `ps` means you want to list down all containers that are running

`grep` is used to search, `-q` means quiet mode for grep so that it does not output, but returns exit status as in either 1 or 0, true of false

we use `|` pipe operator to pass output from docker ps to grep
so we wanna find in docker container list for the container that has the word postgres in one of its prop (list of containers are list of container prop like its id, image name, status...)

then it checks if the dir path exists, if not it exists the whole bash script, we change dir since the docker compose yaml is somewhere else, when we are done we wanna go back up dir

then it check if machine is using old docker or new docker, old one looks like this docker-compose, new one is docker compose
