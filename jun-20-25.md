# summary of what i did today

- install docker engine in my ubuntu
- scaffold readme content for my coffee-shop-api
- learn what iptables are

## install docker engine on ubuntu

to get docker engine in ubuntu, i visit this site https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

what is docker engine?

docker engine is a software that lets me
- get images (class)
- make container from images (instance class)

docker engine is made out of
- demon
- rest api
- cli

1. check for prereq first
2. follow installation steps

---

the prereq

- firewall limitation
- os req
- uninstall old versions

for firewall limitation, i have to be aware of the following

when using ufw or firewalld, when i expose container ports, it might be exposed to the internet

ufw = uncomplicated firewall
FE that comes in ubuntu
u use it to manage firewall
Docker & ufw are not compatible, this is due to how they use ip tables
long story short, exposed container port, packages get diverted before going to ufw firewall settings, this is cuz docker routes traffic using nat table, it diverts packages before input and output that ufw uses
which means, docker takes precedence over where packages go before ufw had a chance!

docker is compatible only with iptables-nft and iptables-legacy
sys with nft firewall rules are not supported on a sys with docker installed
so
make sure any firewall u make are made with iptables or up6tables
also add it to the DOCKER-USSER chain
so
on linux, docker make rules in iptables and ip6tables, this is how they can make isolation, and other port exposure
do not modify this okay
but if u are connected to the internet
you want to add iptables policies to prevent unauth access to containers from outside! so you have to activate that first

todo
read this
https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/
to know how to add iptables policies to avoid unauth access to ur containers
