# summary of what i did today

- learn bash
- setup repo coffee-app-api + local-start.sh

## learn bash

```bash
trap cleanup SIGINT SIGTERM EXIT
```

`trap` is bash built in command, to tell which func to execute when shell gets certain signals

this binds `cleanup` func to run when any of these signals are fired `SIGINT SIGTERM EXIT`

`SIGINT` = `ctrl + c`

`SIGTERM` = from app to politely ask script to stop

`EXIT` = pseudo event, triggers when script exits

---

the following checks for node.js

the command_exists is a user defined func, see yesterday diary to see what it is

`>` redirect output to file

`|` send output to another command

`cut` get section of text, `-d` = delimiter, `f` which field to take
so `node -v | cut -d 'v' -f 2`
means `v20.11.1`, take 2nd part = `20.11.1`

then `echo "$NODE_VERSION" | cut -d '.' -f 1`
`20.11.1` -> `20`

`lt` = less than, int comparator operator

`export` = make var available to all child processes
e.g.
`MY_VAR="hello"` = only avail in current session
run another app from this shell, it will not see that var
so
export var in shell A
invoke anything else from shell A, they will have access to export var
but not shell B
if we run child processes, you can make it accessible with `export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"`

nvm will install at home dir at .nvm dir
so we put where we install .nvm path to that var and export it

`if [ -d "$NVM_DIR" ]; then` = `-d` used to check if path exists

use `-f` to check for if file exists

`# shellcheck disable=SC1091` = eslint comment kind of thing to tell that "Yes, I know this file might not be resolvable at analysis time — it's fine, skip the warning"

`source "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"` = Run the nvm.sh script in the current shell session, so that its functions (like nvm use, nvm install) become available immediately.

`if nvm install 20 && nvm use 20; then` = If nvm install 20 and nvm use 20 both succeed, then do something

because on success, it returns 0 = exit code 0
return 0 on success, and 1 or other codes on failure

in bash, 0 = true, anything else is false

```bash
if ! command_exists node; then
  exit 1
else
  NODE_VERSION=$(node -v | cut -d 'v' -f 2)
  NODE_MAJOR_VERSION=$(echo "$NODE_VERSION" | cut -d '.' -f 1)
  if [ "$NODE_MAJOR_VERSION" -lt 20 ]; then
    export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
    if [ -d "$NVM_DIR" ]; then
      if [ -f "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ]; then
        # shellcheck disable=SC1091
        source "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
      else
        exit 1
      fi

      if command_exists nvm; then
        if nvm install 20 && nvm use 20; then
          NODE_VERSION=$(node -v | cut -d 'v' -f 2)
        else
          exit 1
        fi
      else
        exit 1
      fi
    else
      exit 1
    fi
  else
  fi
fi
```

---

this is how we check for docker compose

check if docker compose command is there

try to call version, if its nothing, exit, any stdout 2 and stderr 1 are purged to black hole

```bash
if ! command_exists docker-compose; then
  if ! docker compose version >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    exit 1
  else
  fi
else
fi
```

---

this is how we check for running docker

try the docker info, stdout2 and stderr1 purged to blackhole
if it does not gimme anything then exit 1

`docker info` gives you a summary of your Docker environment

```bash
if ! docker info >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  exit 1
else
fi
```

---

check for .env file

`if [ ! -f "asd/asd/asd/asd/.env" ]` = check if a .env file exists

```bash
if [ "$IS_INIT" = false ]; then
  if [ ! -f "asd/asd/asd/asd/.env" ] || [ ! -f "asd/asd/.env" ] || [ ! -f "asd/asd/.env" ]; then
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

---

copy the example env into .env

```bash
if [ "$IS_INIT" = true ]; then

  if [ ! -f "asd/asd/.env" ]; then
    cp .env.example asd/asd/.env
  fi
```

---

install pre commit
if file is there, turn it into executable, and run it

```bash
  if [ -f "pre-commit-install.sh" ]; then
    chmod +x pre-commit-install.sh
    ./pre-commit-install.sh
  else
  fi
fi
```

---

docker ps = list detail for each running container, pipe it and grep it
Check if any running Docker container contains the word "postgres" in its details — and do not print anything, just return success or failure.
-q: stands for quiet mode.

until... do is bash loop, keeps running as long as the command keeps failing (not 0)

docker exec <container-name> <command>

"Run this command inside a running container."

pg_isready -U postgres

A PostgreSQL utility that checks if the server is ready to accept connections for user postgres

0 = ready

```bash
if docker ps | grep -q "postgres"; then
else
  cd ./asd/asd/asd/asd || exit
  if command_exists docker-compose; then
    docker-compose up -d
  else
    docker compose up -d
  fi

  cd ../../../..

  until docker exec postgres-container pg_isready -U postgres; do
      sleep 1
    done
fi
```

---

use npx to run something to a port
grab latest ran port id and store to a var
wait for that port to not stop this script

use concurrently to let the bash be able to still accepts stdout from logs

```bash
npx concurrently
PID=$!
wait $PID
```
