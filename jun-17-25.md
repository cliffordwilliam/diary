# summary of what i did today

- installed ubuntu
- get github cli
- get git
- setup multi account bash automation

## install ubuntu

i go here https://ubuntu.com/

then find their products, i want the desktop https://ubuntu.com/desktop

click the download button on that page to go here https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop

at the time of writing the lts is `Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS`

and this page says https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle

				release		end
24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat) 	Apr 2024 	Apr 2029

this site says https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases

				release			end
Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS		February 20, 2025	June 2029

when it is about to end

Trust the Software Updater app to tell you when an upgrade is ready and guide you through it
for managing upgrades, including upgrading between LTS releases

on this page https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop
click the download button to get `Intel or AMD 64-bit architecture`

1. Download the ISO image
2. Create a bootable USB flash drive with balenaEtcher or similar
3. Boot your laptop or PC from the USB flash drive

enter boot menu with boot key, refer to computer to find your boot key

make sure not to connect to internet as you install it

then just pick all default to install and that is it

## install gh, github on command line

because i can work faster from there

how i did it

i visit this site https://cli.github.com/
which has a button that leads me here https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md
which is a github hosted md file
it says `We focus on popular Linux distros and the following CPU architectures: i386, amd64, arm64, armhf.`

i am using `uname -m` to find machine hardware name

it is `x86_64`

amd64 is 64 bit x86, same as `x86_64`
both refer to
A 64-bit CPU architecture based on the x86 instruction set, originally developed by AMD.
x86 instruction set is a set of instruction supported by intel processors

so my processor is `x86_64` or `amd64`, meaning that it has intel compatible x86 instruction sets, made by intel, and can process 64 bits of data at one time

on this page `https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md`

under the official sources, for ubuntu, it has installation snippet

```bash
(type -p wget >/dev/null || (sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install wget -y)) \
	&& sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/keyrings \
        && out=$(mktemp) && wget -nv -O$out https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
        && cat $out | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null \
	&& sudo chmod go+r /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
	&& echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null \
	&& sudo apt update \
	&& sudo apt install gh -y
```

and this is how to upgrade it, but when the GUI software updater gets an update, it will also update gh and other stuff i installed with it

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
```

use this to read what commands they have

```bash
gh help
```

which prints out help and also this link to their online doc https://cli.github.com/manual/

## installing git

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
git --version
```

set default branch to `main`

and also set pull to not rebase, but to merge

```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
git config --global pull.rebase false
```

DO NOT DO THE FOLLOWING, I HAVE MADE AN AUTOMATED BASH FOR IT

make keys, add comment to know who owns the key (use email since its unique), lastly define filename

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "personal@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_personal

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "work@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work
```

login using gh, this pushes the key to remote for you

```bash
gh auth login
gh auth logout
```

make config, to set alias and their definitions, like which ssh key to use `~/.ssh/config`

```bash
Host github.com-personal
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_personal

Host github.com-work
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work
```

then to make working easier we have to organize the dir like this

```text
dev/
├── personal/
│   ├── repo1/
│   └── repo2/
├── work/
│   ├── repoA/
│   └── repoB/
```

per account create `~/.gitconfig-personal`

```bash
[user]
  name = Personal Name
  email = personal@example.com
```

then per account add this to `~/.gitconfig`

```text
[includeIf "gitdir:/home/user/dev/personal/"]
  path = /home/user/.gitconfig-personal
```

this is the automated bash script, I have placed it in root dir and also in cliffordwilliam repo. It is called `local-multi-git-account-setup.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# -----------------------------
# Step 1: Prompt for Account Information
# -----------------------------

# Prompt for user information (Name and Email)
read -p "Enter the name for this account: " NAME
read -p "Enter the email address for this account: " EMAIL

# Define filename for the SSH keys
SSH_KEY="$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519_$NAME"

# -----------------------------
# Step 2: Generate SSH Keys for New Account
# -----------------------------

echo "Generating SSH key for account ($EMAIL)..."
# Generate SSH keys for the account
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "$EMAIL" -f "$SSH_KEY" -N "" # -N "" sets an empty passphrase

# -----------------------------
# Step 3: Authenticate with GitHub (GH CLI)
# -----------------------------

# Check if GitHub CLI is installed and authenticate
if command -v gh &> /dev/null
then
    echo "Logging into GitHub..."
    gh auth login
else
    echo "GitHub CLI (gh) is not installed. Please install it to proceed with GitHub authentication."
    exit 1
fi

# -----------------------------
# Step 4: Set up SSH config for multiple GitHub accounts
# -----------------------------

echo "Configuring SSH settings for GitHub account $EMAIL..."

# Add SSH config for the account
cat <<EOL >> "$HOME/.ssh/config"
Host github.com-$NAME  
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile $SSH_KEY
EOL

# -----------------------------
# Step 5: Organize Project Directory Structure
# -----------------------------

echo "Creating directory structure for dev projects..."

# Create the directories for the repositories
mkdir -p "$HOME/dev/$NAME"

# -----------------------------
# Step 6: Create and Configure .gitconfig for Multiple Accounts
# -----------------------------

echo "Creating .gitconfig for account..."

# Create a new gitconfig specific to this account
cat <<EOL > "$HOME/.gitconfig-$NAME"
[user]
  name = $NAME
  email = $EMAIL
EOL

# Main .gitconfig: Add include for the new account
echo "Configuring main .gitconfig..."
cat <<EOL >> "$HOME/.gitconfig"
[includeIf "gitdir:$HOME/dev/$NAME/"]
  path = $HOME/.gitconfig-$NAME  
EOL

echo "Setup complete for account $NAME!"
```

Then...

1. go to either personal or work
2. make the project dir and go inside
3. you should still be logged in after the setup.sh script, but if not then login here again to the right account
4. git init
5. gh repo create coffee-shop-api --public --source=. --remote=origin
6. then start working on repo

Do not forget to logout when done

```bash
gh auth logout
```
