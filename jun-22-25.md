then install
sudo apt install ./<filename>.deb
Use apt (your package manager)
Install a local .deb file (Debian package)
The ./ prefix tells apt you're installing a file from your current directory, not from an online repo.

A Debian package (with the .deb extension) is the standard format used to package and distribute software on Debian-based Linux systems like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Kali, etc.

A .deb file is essentially an archive (like a .zip or .tar.gz) that contains:

The program’s compiled binaries
– The actual software that gets installed to /usr/bin, /opt, etc.

Metadata
– Info like the name, version, dependencies, description.

Installation scripts
– Optional scripts that run before or after installation (e.g., for setup or cleanup).

Why Use Debian Packages?

    📥 Easy to install with apt or dpkg

    🔄 Manages dependencies automatically (via apt)

    🧹 Clean uninstall support

    🔐 Signed for security (checks authenticity)
    
A .deb file = portable installer for Debian-based Linux systems.
Like a .msi for Windows or .pkg for macOS.
